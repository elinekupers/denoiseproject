%[ts, conditions] = meg_make_epochs(raw_ts, trigger, epoch_time, fs)
%
% Inputs
%   raw_ts:       time series matrix (samples x channels)
%   trigger:      a vector of stimulus onsets equal in length to first
%                   dimension of raw_ts. Should be all zeros except an
%                   integer to indicate trial onset. These integer values
%                   correspond to the condition number.
%   epoch_times:  a 2 vector of start and end time of the epochs 
%                   (in seconds) relative to the trial onset
%   fs:           sampling rate (Hz)
%   which_data:   string to define which data is used, if 'eye',
%                   then triggers are already defined as timepoints   
%
% Outputs
%   ts:           3D array containing epoched time series (samples by
%                   epoch x channel)
%   conditions:   vector equal in length to the number of epochs. each
%                   entry is the condition number (trigger value) for that
%                   epoch
