1. Dependencies are:
	Statistics Toolbox (v 9.1)
	Signal Processing Toolbox (v 6.22)
	Neural Network Toolbox (v 8.2.1)
	
	Let's check whether there are many functions used. If just one or two, then maybe we can copy then into external or use replacement functions. 

2. hpf function has hardcoded numbers like sample rate is 1000. should we change this?
